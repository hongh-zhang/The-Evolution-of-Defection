These are objects generated in stage 2 when you run the training loop. Everything packed with the dill library.

tn_results.pkl contains a list of tournament summaries (csv) collected during training, which is used to plot the results in the notebook.

p1_xxx.pkl contains the trained DQN, with their loss_list recorded inside.

I've delete most of them to keep the repository lightweight.
