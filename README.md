# The-Evolution-of-Defection
A simple deep RL project on iterated prisoner's dilemma.

(WIP)


### network module
The network module (inside the network folder) could be used standalone to construct simple ANNs by calling `<import network>`.

This will import the following class objects:
- NeuralNetwork
- Linear_layer
- Activation_layer
- BatchNorm_layer
- Dropout_layer

See project.ipynb for example.
