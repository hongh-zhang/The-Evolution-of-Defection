# The-Evolution-of-Defection
A simple deep RL project on iterated prisoner's dilemma.

(WIP)

python 3.8+ is recommended for performance boost.


### tests
MNIST dataset is too large to upload onto github, please manually place them inside the tests folder if you wish to run the tests.

### network module
The network module (inside the network folder) could be used standalone to construct simple ANNs by calling `<import network>`.

This will import the following class objects:
- NeuralNetwork
- Linear_layer
- Activation_layer
- BatchNorm_layer
- Dropout_layer
- Maxout_layer

See tests/nn_test.ipynb for examples.
